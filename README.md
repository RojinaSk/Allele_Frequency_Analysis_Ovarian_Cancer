# Allele_Frequency_Variation_Analysis_Ovarian_Cancer

This project studies the allele frequencies of three Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) – rs1799966(BRCA1), rs1045485(CASP8), and rs144848(BRCA2) across diverse global populations using publicly available data from the 1000 Genomes Project. Understanding the distribution of genetic variations, such as SNPs, across different ancestral backgrounds is essential for identifying potential genetic risk factors for complex diseases like ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer is a complex disease influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Identifying genetic variants associated with ovarian cancer can improve our understanding of its heritability and potential risk factors. SNPs play a critical role in genetic variation, and studying their distribution across populations provides insights into evolutionary patterns and disease susceptibility.
Given that allele frequencies can vary significantly between populations, this analysis aims to visualize these differences and explore potential links between specific alleles and population groups.

This analysis seeks to answer the following biological questions:

1.  How do the allele frequencies of rs1799966, rs1045485, and rs144848 vary across different global populations represented in the 1000 Genomes Project?
2.  Are there distinct patterns or clusters of allele frequencies for these SNPs that correlate with geographic location or ancestry?
3.  Can the analysis of these SNPs provide insights into potential population-specific genetic predispositions that could be relevant to ovarian cancer research?
The analysis followed a systematic approach to process, visualize, and compare allele frequencies across global populations. First, raw data for each SNP was cleaned and transformed to extract allele frequencies for each population. Bar plots were generated to illustrate the frequency distribution of each allele across populations. To enhance clarity, populations were sorted based on allele frequency differences. A combined “barcode plot” was created to compare the most prevalent allele for each SNP across populations. Lastly, allele frequencies were mapped onto a world map, focusing on rs1799966 (T allele), rs1045485 (G allele), and rs144848 (A allele) to examine their geographic distributions.
The barcode plots revealed substantial variation in allele frequencies across populations for all three SNPs. The sorted barcode plot provided a clear comparison of T, G, and A allele frequencies, highlighting population-specific differences. Similarly, the geographic distribution maps suggested potential clustering of allele frequencies, with some regions exhibiting higher prevalence of specific alleles. For example, the T allele of rs1799966 was more frequent in African populations but less common in Asian populations. Likewise, the G allele of rs1045485 showed higher frequency in East Asian populations, particularly in China. The A allele of rs144848 followed a similar trend to rs1799966, with a higher frequency in African populations and a lower frequency in Asian populations.

While this study does not directly establish a link between these allele frequencies and ovarian cancer, the observed population-specific differences suggest potential variations in genetic predisposition. These findings emphasize the importance of considering ancestry and population genetics in disease risk assessments. Further research is required to explore potential associations between these SNPs and ovarian cancer incidence, incorporating statistical validation, functional studies, and clinical data. Understanding these genetic variations could contribute to personalized medicine approaches and targeted genetic screening in diverse populations.
